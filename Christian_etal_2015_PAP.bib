  abstract = {Mozambique ranks third amongst the African countries most exposed to risks from multiple weather-related hazards, suffering from periodic floods, cyclones and droughts. Drought affects by far the largest number of people and climate change is expected to increase exposure to extreme weather. The smallest landholders are especially vulnerable to these shocks, because they cultivate marginal land and are unable to adopt technologies that buffer their productivity against these shocks. In recognition that promoting sustainable irrigation and drainage is essential in making smallholder farmers resilient to these intensifying climate variations, the government of Mozambique has made the development of irrigation a priority for agriculture growth and rural development. Our study aims to address two major constraints to irrigated agricultural production: (1) the absence of mechanized intensification, and (2) the lack of institutional capacity to ensure a sufficient water supply for all farmers within the scheme. Both issues require tackling a collective action problem. The proposed research aims to shed light on which monitoring and accountability interventions can induce higher levels of collective action towards a cooperative, more efficient equilibrium in the management of a common pool resource. The evaluation includes 2 components. First, we will test interventions designed to promote financial literacy and incentives for collective action. Second, we will explore the role of information on the individual and communal distribution of water use in improving water productivity. Both interventions will be evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.}
